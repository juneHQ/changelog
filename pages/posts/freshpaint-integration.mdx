We're excited to announce that we now support **Freshpaint** as a new data source into June.

At June we believe that _Analytics should be available to anyone_ - including teams without technical resources.

When we met the Freshpaint team in San Francisco two weeks ago we learned about their vision to empower non-technical users to configure events using a visual editor, and we loved it.

We[ wrote extensively](https://www.june.so/vision) about our belief that everyone in a company should be empowered to understand how the product is actually being used. Freshpaint combined with June allows precisely that.

Freshpaint auto-tracking allows teams to track their user's actions without engineering resources, their time machine lets companies backfill up to 12 months of data retroactively.

_Connected together, Freshpaint and June feel like magic ğŸª„_

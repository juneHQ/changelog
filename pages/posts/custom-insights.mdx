Last week we released the first version of our AI-powered explorer. This week we're releasing the first version of our custom insights.

**What does this mean?**

Up until now you could only use the insights that we provide. Now you can create your own insights - and include them as part of your reports.

**How does it work?**

At the bottom of every report you'll now find a text box. You can type any question you want, and we'll try to answer it for you. The more questions you ask the better we'll get at answering them.

**Rolling out access**

We're rolling out access to our AI features in batches. The reason behind this choice is that we're learning week by week how to shape the human + AI interactions.

Every week we roll out access to a new batch of users and we try to see what are the common use-cases and whether the retention is high enough.

Our core product has high retention, so we don't want to slap AI on top of it without making sure that it's not just a gimmick. We're seeing very promising results so far, but we need a couple of weeks to see how your usage stabilises.

You can now see an event's properties when you hover over it on the single user screen.

Now you can also sort reports by name! In addition to these, we worked on a bunch of improvements and bugfixes:

- You can use ctrl/cmd + click to open a report in a new tab.
- We fixed some bugs in the funnel conversion insight and the date range selector.
- There's an explicit label in the template setup to show that all events have an OR condition between them.
- Events and Pageviews are now grouped together in the Activity section of the sidebar
- And we also did some database query optimizations

export default ({ children, ...rest }) => (
  <MdxLayout meta={meta} {...rest}>
    {children}
  </MdxLayout>
);

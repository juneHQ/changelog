This week we improved the **feature usage** template. It now includes two more granular views: usage per week and per month.
We also added goals to it so you can set engagement goals at a single feature level.

**Other improvements**

- You can visualize your daily active users for the current day
- You can now pick a trait in a pre-populated list of trait dropdown
- Show full-time range on cohort tables.
- WAU/MAU ratio is available on the [active user template](https://june.so/template/active-users)

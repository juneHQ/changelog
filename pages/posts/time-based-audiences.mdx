Ok! So this week we've pushed a significant improvement to the user retention template. In short, you can now see several retention curves on the retention graph based on the date the users joined the cohort.

We heard from many of you that the retention curve was especially important to make sure you were moving your business in the right direction. With **Time-based audiences** you can see at a glance whether or not your retention is improving over time :)

Other improvements:

- You can disable DAU alerts on the active user remove weekend
- AND you can remove week end to avoid spammy notifications over the weekend
- We fixed the date range rounding issue when you pick a custom date ;)

export default ({ children, ...rest }) => (
  <MdxLayout meta={meta} {...rest}>
    {children}
  </MdxLayout>
);

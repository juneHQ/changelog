This week we focused on improving the UI of your reports list. We made it easier to scan your reports, their names, and start from a new template if needed.

**Other improvements:**

➖ Rework insights, and remove all insights that don’t add value ;)

🎯 Fix goals to have a better experience when setting one up and expiring it

export default ({ children, ...rest }) => (
  <MdxLayout meta={meta} {...rest}>
    {children}
  </MdxLayout>
);

This week the team worked on improving both the security and the speed of the app.

🔐 **Security-wise:** you can finally sign a Data processing Agreement (DPA) if this is a requirement to use June. To get a DPA signed with us you can reach out to us through the in-app chat, or reply to one of these emails :)

⚡️ **Speed-wise**: we've almost finished our migration to a more robust infrastructure which results in a much faster and smoother experience for you!

export default ({ children, ...rest }) => (
  <MdxLayout meta={meta} {...rest}>
    {children}
  </MdxLayout>
);

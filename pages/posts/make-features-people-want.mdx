**We’re excited to announce the all new feature report. The fastest way to validate a feature you’re launching.**

Let’s be real - measuring your feature launches is always an afterthought.

Often, feature success doesn't get measured...

Why is it hard to find time to measure your releases?

Why aren’t teams celebrating weeks of hard work?

Why do you have to build the same dashboards over and over again?

Launching something new into the world is one of the most exciting things that you can do.

Why isn’t measuring your launch an exciting moment for your company?

I think it’s because there’s a lot of grunt work involved to just be able to set up a basic view on your launch.

This changes now. After talking with hundreds of product teams about how they measure their work - we took the best ideas in the world and created the feature report.

Here’s what’s special about it:

**⚡️ Easy set up**: It only takes one line of code to set up your report. We detect your new event and create this report for you automatically.

**🎉 Celebrate**: Why isn’t your team celebrating your first 5, 50 and 500 users? Our reports come with milestones your team can be proud to reach.

**👍 Validate**: Measure overall how many users or companies use, adopt and return to your features to validate its success.

**⭐️ Iterate**: Get feedback on your features from the right people. Talk to who loved your feature, and who tried it once and never came back.

**🤔 Compare**: Compare your launches with the other features in your product. Understand adoption and usage compared to the rest of your product.

We also added easter eggs in this report. Try it out and let us know if you find them!

I hope you’ll love it!

The best feeling with analytics is when you get some great news.

Reaching a new all-time high is one of those moments. Especially on hard-to-move metrics such as your Active Users.

That's why this week we've added an all-time high to your Active Users reports.

**Other improvements**

- Fixed some minor issues on the Company Activation report release to all
- Turned your User Milestones reports into a report you can find in your user list. As a reminder you can now create multiples milestones, they're called "User activation" and "Company activation" reports

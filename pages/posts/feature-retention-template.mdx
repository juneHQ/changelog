We added the [feature retention](https://june.so/template/feature-retention) template to complement our existing [retention](https://june.so/template/retention) template. This template can help you measure how long users stick to a specific feature.

Every line chart with a tooltip now has a better interface to drill down into user lists.

In addition to the above, we worked a bunch of improvements and bugfixes:

- You can dismiss feature discovery cards at the top of some reports.
- We've started to store your report sorting preference so that you don't have to change it every time you open June.
- We started work on our data ingestion pipeline. You can expect more updates on that in the coming weeks!
- We fixed a bug in the feature audit template where we were computing numbers using 'all users for your app' instead of 'users who performed the events you selected for your report', which was leading to lower than actual numbers. Open your feature audit report today to see the correct numbers!
- We also optimized loading speeds for the active users template by making less database queries.

This week we also sent out weekly email digests for the first time! Let us know if you like them and how we can improve.

This week almost all the team took some time off. We still managed to push some fixes to some small improvements.

💅 We polished the user and company level report switcher. Updating the report creation modal and the navbar on each report.

🐛 We fixed a bug that sometimes was making the weekly completion rate wrong on the user activation report.

🆕 We worked on improving the efficiency of our data deletion process. We are now able to delete data from the database in a much faster way.

export default ({ children, ...rest }) => (
  <MdxLayout meta={meta} {...rest}>
    {children}
  </MdxLayout>
);

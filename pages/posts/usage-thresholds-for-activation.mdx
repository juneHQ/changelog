The number 1 piece of feedback we got for our activation report was that sometimes doing an event once isn't enough to activate in a product.

To address this problem we're now introducing an option to select the desired level of usage for your activation milestones.

In plain english you can now consider as activated customers that perform and event more than 5 times.

**Other improvements**

- **Live feed improvements** - You can now filter users in the live feed by event performed and by using the same audience rules that are available in your reports
- Improved report labels UX - you can now create labels from the modal, edit their name and save a direct link to a filtered list of reports in your bookmarks
- The active companies report now supports CSV exports
- Besides these improvements we also fixed 8 bugs that you reported in Intercom like "CMD K doesn't load a report on the second time you select a report with it" and "Activation milestones not always showing in the user profiles"

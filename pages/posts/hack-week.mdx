Once a quarter the team meets in person for a team retreat 🧘
This is the occasion for us to bond and work on delighters that otherwise wouldn't make it on the roadmap.

Here is what came out from it:

- A new design for the sidebar design and the tables
- The possibility to download images for every chart, and to remove the Y axis from them.

- A pop-up to celebrate when you reach an all-time high of active users
- Search & audience filters on your live feed

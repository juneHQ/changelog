When you open your June home, you can now see a summary of your feature usage.

This will help you understand what features are people using in your product.

The new feature usage card includes information about:

- How many times was the feature used
- How many users used the feature
- What’s the percentage of overall adoption

**Other improvements**

- We now show the overall % change of your active users when hovering on charts
- When clicking on a user in the company and users list we don’t open a new tab anymore
- You can now set custom profile images for your users by passing an image url in the “avatar” trait
- In the single contact page it’s now easier to click into the properties of an event and copy the values
- The audience filters on the users list now look like the ones inside the report setup (they don’t overflow the screen and you can pick values)
- Each small insight in the product is now redesigned and has a rounded gray background

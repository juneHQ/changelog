Last week, we significantly [improved the user page.](https://changelog.june.so/changelog/new-user-page)

This time it's the **Company page** turn to get a little refresh.

The new company page now includes relevant information for your to make decisions:

- **the activity tab** gives you the company engagement at a glance, as well as which events drive the most engagement

- **the user tab** gives you the list of users within a company, starting with the most engaged ones

## 📘 The June Method

We're thrilled to share the [June Method](https://june.so/method) with the world! This method is a new take on how modern companies can use data to make quick yet efficient product decisions. We hope it helps you move 10x faster while leveraging data in your day to day.

## Other improvements

- The onboarding is less confusing in case you don't have [Group identify](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/group/) in place
- The modal when we push an update is less noisy when you use June
- The Home clearly tells you when the _identify_ is not properly implemented
- June _SDK_ is in alpha. If you want to give it a try, reply to this email :)
- We've also been writing Guides on "how June uses June". We can't wait to share them with you! 🔜

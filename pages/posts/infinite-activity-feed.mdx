Many of you mentioned that you like to use June activity feed to understand at the most granular level what your customers do.

Previously, we treated this screen as a console to help you make sure Segment data was propagating into June.
**This has changed!**

You can now load as many user activities as you need, and go way further back in the past. Want to check who did what yesterday? No problem, just scroll! 🎰

**Other improvements**

- An individual user page loads a lot faster ⚡️

export default ({ children, ...rest }) => (
  <MdxLayout meta={meta} {...rest}>
    {children}
  </MdxLayout>
);

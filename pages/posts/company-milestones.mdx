We're excited to announce **company milestones** 🎉

If you've used [user milestones](https://changelog.june.so/changelog/user-milestones) then company milestones should be familiar 😉

If not, milestones help you figure out where users / companies are in their journey using your product. Unlike a funnel report, company milestones give you a high-level overview of how many companies reached each critical step in your product, independent of other milestones.

Once you've created your milestones, you can click on each milestone to see which companies reached it or not, and take appropriate actions. Milestones are also available on the company profile, so as you're taking a look at what a particular company has been doing inside your product, you'll get a quick overview of how that company is progressing in their journey using your product.

**Other improvements**

- Relevant templates are easier to find thanks to templates categories
- Metrics for which the time frame is in progress are clearly laid out in grey

The June home gives you a pulse of how your product performs. But it wasn't necessarily relevant for those of you who steer their business at a company level. This has changed 🎉

Introducing **Company Home**. The home now includes metrics at a company level, such as:

- new companies sign up
- power companies
- active and retained companies

All you need to access the company home is to click the switch in the top right corner of the home.

## Other improvements

- We added the **[New companies](https://www.june.so/templates/new-groups)** report
- We fixed the drill down on the user retention report that did not show all users
- You can now zoom into the cards at the top of the active users and active companies' reports
- We improved the trait picking in the audience selection component
- Milestones and June SDK are in alpha! Ping us if you'd like to try them out 😃

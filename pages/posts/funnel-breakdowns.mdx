With user traits you can add dimensions to your users. You can store their plan, their role, or whatever information that may be relevant for your business.

This week we added a setting to break down your funnels by the traits of your users.

An example of how to get the most out of this feature is if you have a trait for something like your users' persona. With breakdowns, you can separate out your users depending on their role and see at a glance if some personas are more successful than others at activating or at adopting a specific flow in your app.

**Other improvements**

- We shipped a Mixpanel importer within our onboarding flow, you can now import your historical data from Mixpanel. Give it a try!
- Lots of bug fixes and stability improvements

The user page just got an upgrade! 🆙

For many of you, the user page was a nice way to get a detailed view of what a user's actions were. But it lacks some overviews, so we fixed that!

Last week we improved the user page header to include:

- Top performed activity: the header shows the most triggered events and pageviews for a single user. Hover to get the exact count on the number of occurrences

- Live status: the green dot next to the user avatar tells you if the user was live in the past 5 minutes.

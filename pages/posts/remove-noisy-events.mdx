Not all your track events get triggered by users interactions with your product.
Some events may be triggered async from users' behaviors. For instance when a user received an update from your product.

Yet all events are selected when you pick "any events" in June. To avoid that we're introducing a way to remove these system events.
Head to your event list to mark which events are triggered or not by users. When you unselect an event it won't be selected anymore in your definition of "any events".

**Mixpanel importer**
You can now import your data from Mixpanel in a few clicks and avoid a cold start with June.
Here is how it works: [https://guides.june.so/mixpanel-importer](https://guides.june.so/mixpanel-importer)

**Other improvements**

- You can select an audience based on when it performed a specific event ("in the last X days / weeks / months")

- We fixed an issue with user and company searches
- We fixed an issue with audience filters not always working within Slack notification

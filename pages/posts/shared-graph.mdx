**Shared graph**

This week we've made sharing your graphs one by one even simpler 🎉

You can click the three dots button in the top right corner of a chart to share a private or public link right to it. When you generate a public link you'll get an embeddable code that will allow you to take your metrics anywhere on the web, like on a Notion page or your investor updates.

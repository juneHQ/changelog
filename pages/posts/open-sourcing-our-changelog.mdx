## Iterating on the feature report

Last week we had a big launch with the feature report so we followed up on the release with 4 improvements:

![](https://june-changelog.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/open-sourcing-our-changelog/feature-adoption.png)

We updated the adoption chart on the report to show the numbers of users that use the feature for the first time over time.

We added a live users count on the report - so you can see who's using each feature right now.

We added search on the drill-downs - so you can search for a specific user or a specific company every time you click into a chart.

We disabled the milestones pop-ups when a feature is not in "Launch mode" - so you don't hammered with pop-ups when you're not launching a feature (thanks Brian for the feedback!)

## Open sourcing our Changelog

At the core of June is our changelog. The heartbeat of our company beats weekly. With every weekly changelog we try and bring to the world a little bit of our vision. A product analytics tool that is warm and human, that is easy to use, and that is built with love.

This week we're releasing an updated version of our open source changelog. What's great about it is that it's now fully customizable, and it doesn't require using Strapi anymore so you can use it for your own projects.

The new version uses MDX and Next.js, and it's fully customizable. You can find the [source code here](https://github.com/juneHQ/changelog).

To create your own weekly changelog, you can follow the instructions in the README. It should take you less than 10 minutes to get it up and running!

If you do end up using our Changelog, let us know so we can feature you!

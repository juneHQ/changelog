In B2B every time someone signs up for your product you want to run a quick Google search to qualify them.

What if June could do this for you automatically?

We built this, using Google Search and GPT-3, and are launching it today for all June.so users.

## How does it work

When someone signs up for your product, June will automatically run a bunch of Google searches and return the results to some GPT-3 prompts.

The prompts will ask GPT-3 to read the results from the Google searches and then answer a few questions about the person who signed up.

The answers to these questions will be used to enrich your user profile and qualify them!

The fields that June will enrich are:

- Company
- Job Title
- Location
- Company Size
- Funding amount
- Linkedin Profile
- Crunchbase Profile

Here's an example of what the results look like:

How to set this up:

1. Set up a Slack channel

2. Setup a June instant event notification to send notifications for new sign ups to the Slack channel

3. Enable the June enrichment feature on the event notification

## Why did we build this?

Our main focus at June has been on improving our product for B2B Saas companies. One of the main things we learned is that every B2B company looks up their users on Google to qualify them.

So then we thought, why not automate this process and make it easy for B2B companies to do this?

We think that building and supporting this kind of specific workflows is the key to build a 10x better way of doing product analytics specifically tailored to B2B SaaS companies.

## What's next?

Over the coming weeks we'll keep fine tuning the results we return and add more fields to enrich. We'll be also start to send this enrichement data into your June user and company pages - and even allow you to send this data to Hubspot using our integration.

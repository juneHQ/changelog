We heard from you that report names weren't very intuitive and that it wasn't clear what to expect them to look like once they're set up.

<br />
So we've updated the report creation flow and we now allow you to see how a template looks like, before
setting it up! ⚡️

<br />

**Other improvements**

- We rolled out a big under the hood database change. This release has been 3 months in the making and will allow us to build more advanced features for audience filters and account-based analytics. It also opens up a lot of possibilities for us to integrate data from pageviews in reports. From the next changelog, you should start seeing some of the features that this new migration enables!
- In other news, next Monday we'll be growing our team. Our friend and colleague from Intercom Adis is joining our team in two weeks!

export default ({ children, ...rest }) => (

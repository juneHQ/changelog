**“I don’t have Segment installed on my app. Can I still use June?”**

**Yes! You can now use June without Segment. You can still use Segment if you want to, but you don’t have to.**

Before sharing the details of this big news with you though I wanted to share with you the motivations behind our strategy. I think as a fellow startup founder you’ll appreciate the thought process behind the timing of this decision.

We started working on June two years ago now. We started building it because let’s be honest - most people at a tech company don’t have a clue of how their product is being used.

We think that this is because of two reasons:

- Existing product analytics tools are complex and time consuming to use.
- People don’t have the time to learn what and how they should be tracking. And even if they do, there aren’t any good resources to know how to act on what they learn.

We wanted to build a tool that is easy to use and that would give you the insights you need to make better decisions with the least setup possible.

With these easy to use insights calculated in the same way for every digital product, we then built benchmarks that would allow you to compare your product to others in your industry.

We then built insights - with call to actions - to help you talk with the right users to get the feedback you need to make a better product.

To test that our assumptions were correct we built June on top of Segment.

Companies using Segment were a great test market for us. This is because Segment customers already have access to any other product analytics tool they want. This forced us to build something that is both different and valuable enough to be worth switching to.

We also had the advantage of being able to connect to Segment data in a couple of clicks, which made it easy for us to onboard thousands of customers.

Now that we’ve been able to test our assumptions and validate our product-market fit with thousands of B2B SaaS companies, we’re ready to take the next step.

We’re now ready to build June on top of our own data pipeline. This will allow us to build a product that is even easier to use and that will give you even more insights.

So today I’m happy to share with you our June SDK and documentation. The June docs help you get started in the same way we help you do product analytics.

We made our docs short and to the point. We also made them easy to follow. We think you’ll be able to get started collecting real data in your product in less than 20 minutes.

**June SDKs**

Our SDKs include React, Node, Ruby, Python and an HTTP API if you use any other programming language.

📚 You can find our new [June docs here](https://www.june.so/docs)

We hope the June SDKs make your first step into the world of analytics delightful

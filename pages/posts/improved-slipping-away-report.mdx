This week we improved the **Slipping Away template** to be a lot more intuitive and actionable.

You can now select a dynamic time range to spot users that are disengaging with your product without having to update your set up. At the top you can see the users that disengage the most recently, you can also copy their email in 1-click.

This will help you reach out to your churning users so you can make your product better.

As quick customer support and tailored onboardings become table stakes for most Saas businesses, proactive support is how you can differentiate.

**Other releases**

- We improved our feature flagging system allowing better experimentation over the next weeks
- Improved the UI on the side panel when zooming in on individual users
- Added missing loaders on some reports, to make it obvious when data is getting (re)loaded

export default ({ children, ...rest }) => (
  <MdxLayout meta={meta} {...rest}>

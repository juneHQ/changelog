This week we're releasing something that has been in the works for quite some time.

We're introducing the June Tracking SDK. WIth the June tracking SDK, you can now implement June directly, without having to have Segment or Freshpaint.

With this release we're rolling out support for the following programming languages:

- Ruby
- Javascript (both Node and in the browser)
- Python

We're also publishing our Tracking API in case we don't support your favorite programming language out of the box.

You can find all of our developer documentation on our website at [june.so/docs](https://www.june.so/docs).

Let us know if you need any help getting up and running by reaching out via Intercom

export default ({ children, ...rest }) => (
  <MdxLayout meta={meta} {...rest}>
    {children}
  </MdxLayout>
);

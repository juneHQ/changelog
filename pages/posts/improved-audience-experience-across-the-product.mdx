This week is full of great updates across the whole product, especially when it comes to filtering users!

If you've been adding the same audience rules over and over again, we've now made it super easy to select the same rules again for your new reports. We do this by highlighting some recommended filters any time you create a new report.

If instead, you spend your days using our users list, we revamped the audience rules pickers there. The filters you can apply are as powerful as the ones within a report.

Besides this we also now allow you to delete individual users from user pages. This action allows you to delete test users and all of their events.

We also fixed 7 annoying bugs:

- Feature audit breaks with certain event names
- Quotes in event trait values sometimes break user insights
- All-time high notifications sometimes get sent even when there's no all-time high
- Active users' notifications don't match the report
- A bug with company home cards for the new companies report
- The feature card on the home looked broken on Safari

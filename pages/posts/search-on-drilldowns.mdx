When you start to have a lot of users it becomes hard to find out whether a user was active or not on a given day!

For this reason, we've added a search bar on each of our drill-downs. This allows you to click on a chart and then be able to search for a specific user you're looking for.

**Other improvements**

- We fixed some issues with our Mixpanel importer
- The most engaged users card sometimes was showing "Unknown" even if we had the correct traits
- Some of our report insights were timing out when event filters contained "less than"
- The new users report top card drill-down didn't show any users, we fixed it now!

export default ({ children, ...rest }) => (
  <MdxLayout meta={meta} {...rest}>
    {children}
  </MdxLayout>
);

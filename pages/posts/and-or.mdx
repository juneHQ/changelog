You can now filter audiences through some more advanced ANR/OR combinations!

No more hacking around your user's traits to allow complex logic. Instead, you may simply play with the filters and leave room to your imagination.

In case you are using numbers as users' trait values, you can also use comparison operators (less than, greater than) to filter on them.

**Other improvements:**

- We have two new templates in beta: sign-up conversion rate, and product activation. Want to give them a shot in advance? let us know we'd be happy to enable them for you.
- Target users [for feature adoption template](https://june.so/template/feature-usage) is now more accurate. It only takes into account the users that used your product on and after the day your feature was introduced.
- We added a time picker for your WAU and MAU
- You can sort users who are slipping away by their volume of activity

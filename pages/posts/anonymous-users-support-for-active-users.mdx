We've started to roll out the support of anonymous users in June, starting with the Active Users template. It's currently in beta.

The support will be rolled out to everyone next week after we fully support the Active Users template with all its bells and whistles. Let us know in the chat if you'd like to try it out earlier!

Once you're opted-in, you will be able to select the anonymous user type in your Active Users report setup like below, after which you will be able to see a stacked count of anonymous users in all your active users graphs.

**Other fixes**

- Fixed the Feature Audit template which wouldn't load for some of you.
- Fixed some of the public template pages which wouldn't load.

It's the last week of the year so the team also took some well deserved time off.

Happy New Year!

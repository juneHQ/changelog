Have you ever wondered who are your most engaged companies? Your least ones?

The most engaged company template lets you figure this out! Similar to another report, you can pick the actions against which you want to measure company engagement.

Once the report is generated you can click on a company to get the detailed breakdown per user.

**Other improvements**

- You can invite colleague from a sidebar shortcut
- You can share graph from your feature release reports

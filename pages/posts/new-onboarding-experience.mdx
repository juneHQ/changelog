This week we focused on revamping the onboarding experience for June. We introduced an optional onboarding call as we realised a 15 minute call with us can really make a difference when it comes to getting value from the product.

[Feel free to book a call here if you had trouble setting up your June workspace](https://calendly.com/enzo-a/)

Other than that:

✨Any time a new version of June is pushed we now display a notification. Before this some of our users were getting blank screens when we pushed some breaking changes to our APIs

✨Performance improvements to the Power Users template (it now loads 10x faster for large workspaces)

🐛Feed layout in Safari looks good now

🐛The report title editor now is full width

We also spent quite some time squashing more under the hood bugs and addressing some of our technical debt.

Vinayak (we're still just a team of 3), is currently in Delhi where the COVID situation is really troubling. If you want to contribute to the relief funds [here's](https://actgrants.in/donate/) a good place to do it.

If you're currently in India stay strong and best wishes from the June team

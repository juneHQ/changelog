When you visit a company profile you can see a chart of how many events they're doing in your product. This chart is helpful to see the overall whether a company is using your product more and more or less and less.

Now you can click into these charts and get a breakdown of who are the users that were active within the company and what actions they performed.

To try this out go on a company or user page and click into the activity chart, just like you would do on a report!

**Other improvements**

- The active companies report now supports CSV exports
- The active users report now supports usage thresholds. This means you can define users as active only if they used a feature more then a couple of times in a day!
- Fixed some issues with reports not reloading correctly after setup changes

export default ({ children, ...rest }) => (
  <MdxLayout meta={meta} {...rest}>
    {children}
  </MdxLayout>
);

You listened to your customers, came up with a great solution to their problem, and shipped it. Now what?

Time to find out if you solved your customers' problems. One of the best ways to find out is to measure your feature adoption.

This is what the ğŸ†• new [feature release report](https://www.june.so/templates/feature-release) allows you to do.

Here is how it works

1. Define the events for when a feature is **discovered**, **set up**, and **adopted**
2. We automatically detect users who interacted with your product since the feature was introduced
3. Click **done**, and let the magic happen ğŸª„

Want feedback from users who discovered your feature but did not set up or adopt your feature? Click the bar chart and export the emails in a CSV.

For quick access to your features, we also added them to your Home.

**Other improvements**

- Add tabbed drill down with new and returning users on active user reports
- Fixed a bug where last seen date on the user list was using the last identify, but not the user profile

export default ({ children, ...rest }) => (
  <MdxLayout meta={meta} {...rest}>
    {children}
  </MdxLayout>
);

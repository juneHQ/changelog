If you have a lot of reports, then finding the right one can be painful.

To make your life easier we're excited to introduce labels.

Labels are a flexible way to organise reports in the way you want, whether it's by theme (activation, retention), team (core product team, success team) - or anything else really

Labels can be added when a report is opened:

You can then edit them from the settings:

And of course, you can filter your report list using them:

If you're a b2b Saas company you don't really care what actions individual users take.. What matters is if the companies signing up for your product successfully onboard, activate, convert and expand. Sometimes all these things can be done by multiple users within your app.

So in this week's update, we introduced Company level funnels to help you measure whether companies complete flows within your app.

**Improvements of the week**

- We fixed some reloading issues with the DAU chart not refreshing automatically after editing the report setup
- We updated the design of the bin to delete events from a report setup, to make it more obvious
- We added a load more button on the Slipping away users report
- We improved the performance of all insight cards and most side panels that load users - they should now load all at once, no more flickering
- We added an insight card on the new users report to show you how many sign-ups you're getting from each source
- We implemented one-click authentication from our homepage using Google One Tap

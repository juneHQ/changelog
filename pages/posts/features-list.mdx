This is the first update since the new year and it’s filled with some great quality of life improvements.

We added a new card on the home that allows you to compare the usage of all your features at a glance.

June until now has been great to measure high level metrics, and we’re now moving some of our focus towards helping you understand what people are doing in your product.

**Other fixes:**

- We fixed the preview of the feature usage report
- We pushed some improvements to the traits discovery experience. So we now show educational materials to help users learn about traits.
- We pushed a fix to our company funnel. In some cases it was only filtering users based on its first event instead of each step.
- We fixed some bugs that saved audiences had that were causing the report setup to be reset
- We pushed a fix on the navbar of company level reports that was showing “users” instead of “companies” as an audience

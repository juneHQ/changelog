You can now save groups of users and companies in audiences. These audiences can then be re-used across all of your reports.

This makes it super easy to split your users into groups and then compare them against each other.

Some of our favorite use cases for audiences we've seen so far are:

- Non-teammates - Remove teammates from your reports
- Trialing - Save users that are on a trial to make sure they convert
- Paying customers - To make sure your revenue is healthy
- New users - To make sure your onboarding is working

To make these audiences even more powerful we introduced two new filters you can use:

- Performed any action - This will allow you to create an audience of users that have performed any action in the last X days. This is great for creating an audience of users that have been active in the last 7 days.

- Performed their first action - This will allow you to create an audience of users that have performed their first action in the last X days. This is great for creating an audience of users that have signed up in the last X days.

You can find the new audiences feature in the left sidebar under "Audiences". The existing Companies and Users tabs have been moved to the "People" section.

Also to make this even better - we're now automatically generating two audiences for you:

- Last week's new customers - This will be a list of all the users that signed up in the last week.

- Last week's active customers - This will be a list of all the users that performed any action in the last week.

# Company events

You can now use the company field in your events to assign specific events to a company.

This allows you to filter events performed within a specific company across your whole product (so this applies in the companies page too, not just reports).

To specify a company for an event you need to add a groupId to your events. You can find our documentation on how to do this [here](https://help.june.so/en/articles/5988339-why-when-to-adopt-groups).

You can enable this by heading to the Settings & Integrations section of the product:

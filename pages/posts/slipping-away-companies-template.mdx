🆕 **New template**

![ezgif.com-gif-maker (22).gif](https://june-changelog.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/ezgif_com_gif_maker_22_e1c7cbeb80.gif)
We just released the slipping away companies template. Just like you can understand when your users are [slipping away users](https://june.so/template/slipping), you can find out when companies drift away from your product so that you can re-engage with them.

🆕 **New template**

We also enabled the first template for marketing purposes. It's called the [sign-up conversion template](https://june.so/template/signup-conversion). This template helps you measure drop-offs in your signup flow by showing you how many [visitors converted to users](https://changelog.june.so/changelog/differentiate-between-users-and-visitors) in your product. This template is useful once you focus more heavily on user acquisition.

**Other improvements**

- The [Amplitude data importer](https://changelog.june.so/changelog/amplitude-importer) is more scalable and can deal with data of any size.
- You can drill down on feature adoption usage graph
- & other bug fixes that came up during the week.

📕 **New playbook**

After a lot of research, we launched our [power users playbook](https://june.so/template/power-users) which covers the following questions:

1️⃣ How do you find your hardcore users?

2️⃣ How can you find more of them?

3️⃣ How should you price your product?

We believe that knowing your power users is among the most underleveraged way to build the right product with the right monetization strategy.

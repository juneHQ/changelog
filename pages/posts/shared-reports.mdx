Share reports with your team and investors! In this week's release, we built a feature that allows you to share reports links with your data to your team and investors.

A great use case for these links is investor updates. We're curious to see how you'll use them, surprise us!

**Other improvements**

- We redesigned the event feed

- You can now filter out a specific keyword from your event notifications
- We added error pages to the product, so when things crash you won't get white screens anymore
- We made our home page more lightweight (so it loads faster)
- We improved the design of our public [template](https://june.so/templates) pages
- The changelog is now paginated, so not all changes will be loaded at once

For the first time, you can use your pageviews inside of a report!

Starting with the funnel - _and soon all other reports_ - you can now create events from your page views.

We think this is a game-changer for all the non-technical people on your team that want to be able to measure activity independently.

As a side note, in the funnel, the page views we'll consider are only the ones that come from identified users.

**Other improvements**

- We worked on fixing some latencies issues that were causing long report loading times and slow report creation and set up. Setting up a report should always be fast now.

- We revamped our properties picker for events in the funnel report:

- Pending traits you just added will show up grayed out, while theyâ€™re being added on the contact page

- We redesigned the company page to be consistent with the rest of the product

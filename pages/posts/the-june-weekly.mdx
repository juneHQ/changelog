Great products don't "make you think". That's why we're making June even more simple to use each day.

To execute on this vision we've decided to automatically measure and send you one of your company most relevant pieces of information, your number of active users 📊

Starting next week you'll receive your weekly workspace update on Monday, without lifting a finger.

**Other improvements**

- We're made the report generate a lot faster 🌊
- Right after you sign up we offer you a first automatically set up report ⚡️
- We are mapping each of your tracking events to their exact sources. This is a baseline to show you the environment that each of your event comes from 🔜

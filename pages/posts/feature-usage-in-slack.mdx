You just released a new feature and want to understand its popularity?
Good news! The latest update to our Slack integration sends you updates about a specific feature usage. Either once a day, or once a week, you pick =)

To get started, pick and set up the "feature usage" template. Then head to the top right corner and enable the Slack notification.

**Other improvements**

- Progress on our new database migration ğŸ¦œ
- Some weeks are harder than others, this was on them. One of our team members got injured ğŸ’œ

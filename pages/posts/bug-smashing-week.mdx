This week as a team we focused on fixing as many bugs as possible.

After a year of weekly changelogs shipping new features, we decided to spend some time cleaning up some of the defects in our product so that you can have a smoother experience.

**Some of the bugs we addressed**

- app crashing on specific actions
- funnel didn't work with today data
- slow report sorter dropdown
- sidebar open/close state inconsistency
- adding a trait for a single user had issue
- UI fixes on the feature adoption template
- clunky experience when selecting page events in the User Retention template
- AND MANY MORE =)

**New Playbook**

Does someone love your product? ğŸ’œ

If youâ€™re building a consumer product or business software that people use regularly, you should be looking at your power users.

The chances are that their behavior in your app or a conversation with them will inspire your next big bet.

- Is anyone a hardcore fan of your product that canâ€™t spend a day without using it?
- Over time are you doing a better job at activating your hardcore users?

These are the questions that you can answer with a power users analysis:

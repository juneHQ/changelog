Sometimes, absolute numbers matter less than relative numbers.
This is the case if you want to make sure that you are growing your business.

Last week we added the option to view your new users and your active users as an evolution (in %) versus the previous period.
The feature is accessible right on your graph in the tooltips:

Also we shared more broadly about the importance of measuring your growth and how Y Combinator nailed that topic:

**Other improvements:**

- auto-refresh your workspaces list so you always know which workspace you have access to
- the company retention preview is fixed
- Company trait picker had a bug where it would pick user trait instead. It's fixed 😉
- Opening audience filters opened all your filters. This is fixed too!

export default ({ children, ...rest }) => (
  <MdxLayout meta={meta} {...rest}>
    {children}
  </MdxLayout>
);

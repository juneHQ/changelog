This week we've added a better way to interact with [time-based audiences](https://changelog.june.so/changelog/time-based-audiences) on the user retention template.

You can now use the dropdown on the retention graph to select the time-based audiences you want to compare retention curves for. Ideally you should see your time-based cohorts moving upward.

Other improvements:

- The single-user screen now automatically opens in a new tab when you click on a user with the drill-downs in your reports. This helps you keep the focus.
- In addition to these, we worked on database/infrastructure upgrades, app should feel faster!

export default ({ children, ...rest }) => (
  <MdxLayout meta={meta} {...rest}>
    {children}
  </MdxLayout>
);

Many of you were using the "engagement" reports to receive individual notifications. This took you a lot of time and resulted in cluttered list of reports.

To fix that you can now enable alerts when an **event is triggered** in two clicks, right from the event list.

Next time you want to celebrate when an important event is triggered, head to the "event" list and click on the 🔔 **bell icon** on the right.

This is what a notification looks like:

**☝️ Note**: If you set up the slack integration for some "engagement" reports, we are automatically migrating your notifications to the event list.

**Other improvements:**

- The templates names and descriptions were improved
- The Slack notification for the Slipping away report does not show "null" names anymore
- June color palette just got much bigger! No more black legends ⚫️

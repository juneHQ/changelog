**Duplicate reports**

Reports can get quite complex, and sometimes you just want a similar one, almost duplicating its setup.
Minus one or two things. This is now something you can do through the duplicate option on a report.

**Search users & companies**

Christmas came early. One of the most anticipated features you requested.
You can now search for users by email, or by any other trait or event. In addition to searching users, you can now also search for companies by name or trait.

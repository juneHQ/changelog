Have you ever set up a report but don't remember what setup it was? Maybe a colleague set the report up?
Or perhaps you're just sharing a report with some colleagues and want to give them some context?

Then we have good news: report setups are now front and center at the top of your reports, like this:

Setups are also available within your Slack digests:

A visible setup makes sure everyone clearly understands what they are looking at and avoids misalignment.

**Other improvements**

- Graph descriptions and formulas were added below some graphs (beta)
- Slack notifications for your events can get triggered for unidentified users (when there are no audience filters applied)
- CSV exports on the user list had a bug with some filters - we fixed it!
- We also clarified when to use group id in event context which created some confusion.

export default ({ children, ...rest }) => (
  <MdxLayout meta={meta} {...rest}>
    {children}
  </MdxLayout>
);

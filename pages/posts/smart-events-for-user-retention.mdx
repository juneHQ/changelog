This week we added "smart event" support for the [user retention](https://june.so/template/retention) template!

Previously, it wasn't possible to get your User Retention if you missed implementing a signup event for the new users joining your app. Now, you can just pick `First event` instead of a signup event, and we'll compute user retention based on the first time your users performed an event in your app.

It also wasn't possible to pick any returning event. Now you can also pick `Any event` as a returning event. This is helpful if you don't want to select most of your events one by one and manually.

What's more? Based on these smart events, we're now showing your number of new users right on the [Home](https://changelog.june.so/changelog/home).

**Other improvements**

- It's easy to differentiate at a glance between user and company filters thanks to new icons.

- [Top feature users template](https://june.so/template/engagement) works again
- When [Companies](https://changelog.june.so/changelog/companies) don't have any "name" trait then we show `Unknown`. If you want to know who these companies are you can set up the [Segment group identify](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/group/) calls with "name" trait.

- We fixed some bugs that came up from the [new template setup](https://changelog.june.so/changelog/new-template-set-up) release from last week.
- Fixed a bug that was making the slipping away template setup crash by [safely navigating](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining) some Javascript code.

We've been getting great feedback on our Slack notifications with enrichment and decided to bring the same functionality and convenience to user and company profiles. Now you can enrich any user or company profile with a single click.

On every user and company profile, you'll see a new Enrich button.

Clicking this button will use a combination of Google and OpenAI's GPT-3 to find the best email and domain for the user or company. This is a great way to quickly find the email of a user or company you're researching.

This feature is the automated equivalent of taking a user's email, pasting it into Google, and looking for the best result. We think this is a great way to save time and automate a tedious task.

How the team has been using this feature:

- When looking at a promising sign-up, we'll enrich them and add them on LinkedIn. This is a great way to get a conversation started.
- When looking at a company, we'll look at their funding and company size to see if they're a good fit for our product. If they are, we'll try and reach out to them to see if there's any way we can help them.

We're excited to see how you use this feature. If you have any feedback, please let us know!

**Other improvements**

- We pushed some improvements to our onboarding experience. We now have a banner across the app that guides people to fix their setup before using June. This is to make sure people have the right data to get the most out of June.

Find out all the **activities on a single-track event** in a snap 👀

Head to the activity section in the left panel menu to pick the track event you want to investigate. This feature is useful to get all the context you need around a single type of activity. For instance, it can answer the question "who are the last 10 users that opened this feature?".

Last week was a big week for June. We released a new version of our product analytics tool. We also launched a new website and a new brand.

This means that we got a lot of sign-ups. We wanted to make sure that new users get the most out of June. So we redesigned our onboarding experience.

When June started, we were just an app on top of Segment. We didn't have a lot of features. So we didn't need a lot of onboarding.

But now there's a lot more to June. We have a lot of features. We have a lot of different ways to use June. We have a lot of different ways to integrate June.

For instance we know that when integrating our SDK it can take more than 10 minutes to get it right. For this reason we decided to create a new onboarding experience that guides users through the process of integrating June.

This new onboarding makes you land directly in the product. It guides you through the process of integrating June. It highlights the api keys you need to copy and paste and gives you more context about what you're doing.

We hope this new onboarding will help new users get the most out of June.

**Other improvements**

We had a big inflow of new users. So apart from rebuilding our onboarding we just focused on answering support tickets and fixing bugs that we got reports of.

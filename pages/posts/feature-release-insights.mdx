In this week's update, we're highlighting users that keep coming back to a feature and those that never come back to use it.

Whenever you set up a feature release report you can now dive deep into your users' behavior and schedule user interviews with your most and least active users. This will become invaluable to keep building a better product.

**Other improvements**

- We added a chart footer with the formula behind every graph in the product
- The report setup is now visible to all your users even when the report is sent in Slack
- We added a Daily/Weekly/Monthly time picker on the company activity chart (as requested by
  Yassine @ [Manatal](https://www.manatal.com/))

Understanding the engagement on a feature boils down to two things.
How many times the feature was used, **and how many people used it**.

Historically this second part was missed from the feature release report, so we fixed that.

**Other improvements**

- The funnel performance is improved by 5x. This will make it load faster for larger workspaces (up to 100k MAU)
- Activation milestones are now displayed on company pages, and user profiles, and other bug fixing on edge cases with their setup

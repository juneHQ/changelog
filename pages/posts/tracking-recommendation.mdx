This week we added **track events recommendation** in June.

Whether you're getting started, or you've already set up with basic track events, June recommends you the most relevant track events to implement based on your industry. We currently support 3 industries:

1. Mobile app
2. B2B SaaS
3. eCommerce

Each track event comes with an 🖼 illustration and 💌 precanned message you can forward to an engineer in your team to help you.

**Other improvements**

- You can now export .csv of your users for 3 reports: feature users, slipping users, and slipping companies reports

- Keen to explore and compare basic interactions with your track events and page views? We now have a mode for that! It's called the "explorer". You can find it at the top of the report list.

- You now have access to 90 days of historical data for your Daily Active Users (DAU)

- We added the Slack support for the slipping away template, meaning you can be notified in Slack notifications when companies are about to churn
- To avoid any confusion, we'll show you zero on the funnel line chart when you have no data (it used to be empty)

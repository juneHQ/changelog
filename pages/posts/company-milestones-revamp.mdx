In this week's update, we revamped company-level milestones to be a report!

This means that you can now set an audience to your milestones and that you can have different milestones for different types of companies you monitor.

As part of this redesign, we also added a time picker to milestones, so you can use them to track the activation of the companies that sign up for your product.

**Other improvements**

This week we started conducting our yearly penetration test to improve our security. Over the next week or so we'll be monitoring and fixing any findings!

This week we improved the design and performance of audience filters to make them more snappy. We also added support for new types of trait filters, namely; `starts with`, `ends with`, `contains`, `does not contain`, `is unknown`, `has any value`, in addition to the `is` and `is not` from before, which should now let you create more fine-tuned audiences!

We've also started adding support for pageviews in templates, starting with the funnel. We're gonna test it a bit more next week and then release it for everyone at the end of it! Let us know if you want to opt your workspace into the 'pageviews in templates' beta so that you can help us iron out any bugs.

We also worked on adding a search bar on the reports list to improve discoverability for reports, and started showing error messages on public reports to make them work more smoothly, for example when access is denied.

export default ({ children, ...rest }) => (
  <MdxLayout meta={meta} {...rest}>
    {children}
  </MdxLayout>
);

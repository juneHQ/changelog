This week was a bit shorter than usual because of Christmas, but our focus was on improving the overall product experience and quality.

We redesigned the product charts, home and summary card components. Added interactive loaders across the app. We then added error messages when reports fail to load instead of showing infinite loading skeleton.

**Other fixes**

- Fixed a bug that caused reports to reload every time the June window went into focus
- Fixed a bug that always displayed a load more button on the event feed of a single user

export default ({ children, ...rest }) => (
  <MdxLayout meta={meta} {...rest}>
    {children}
  </MdxLayout>
);

What is more motivating and engaging than seeing **new users** joining your product? We iterated on our existing home and now provide you with more [insights on your acquisition](https://june.so/template/new-users). Alongside with retention and active users, these new users metrics give you a great overview of how well your app is doing.

From your home, you see **how many users just signed up to your app**.

Accessing the full report, you can track daily, weekly and monthly signups, as well as their evolution over time.

By selecting **today** option on your daily graph, you get an hourly overview of your new users for the day. You can find out who are these users and make sure your company is growing over time.

**Other improvements:**

- Get an hourly update of [who’s adopting your new features](https://june.so/template/feature-usage) and [who are your active companies](https://june.so/template/active-groups). Similar to new users, in the daily graph you can select **today** option.
- As part of our constant efforts to increase June’s performance, we reduced loading time for our company retention’s report.
- We fixed the display of events name on user profiles, so long event names can be displayed properly.
- Our audience filters are now properly closing.

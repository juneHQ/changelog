This week we added event properties and user traits pickers. Now you can see, not only which properties are available, but their values in order to easily choose the correct property when creating reports.

Similarly, with user traits, you can now see which user trait values are available when defining your audience for a report. Previously, you needed to know these values and populate them in a text input.

**Other improvements**

- We added the shareable insight feature to a few more reports: Power users, Funnel, Sign-up conversion, User retention. This allows you to share insights or simply embed them inside docs, web pages and share them with teammates, business stakeholders etc. More to come here.

- We gave our funnel report some love (thanks for all of the feedback) and added the average time between spent between steps in the funnel report, as well as the ability to click and see the user breakdown for each step of the funnel.

- Finally, we added a checklist to help you get started with June, right in the side menu.

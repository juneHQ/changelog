We added support for account-level analytics with the Active Groups template.

**New design of single user page**

We redesigned the single user page with a better event feed and header.

**Other improvements**

- We've automated product onboarding, with just a few final touches left. Stay tuned for a self-serve onboarding experience in the coming weeks!
- You can now look at the active users for each day, week, and month by clicking on individual points in the Active Users graph
- You can now look at daily, weekly, and monthly Retention across any time period that you want
- You can also select multiple events at the same time while creating a report
- And there are confirmation toasts when you save things!
- We also fixed the funnel template and learned about a subtle difference in list slices between Python and Ruby, with lots of small fixes and improvements across the app

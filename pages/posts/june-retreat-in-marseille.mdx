This week the team gathered in Marseille for its second team retreat 💜

We used this time to chat about the future of June and take a step back. We feel very grateful to receive so much of your feedback. We want to bring the product further than you can imagine! 🧞‍♂️

To get our creative juices flowing the team hacked around some big new ideas.

We can't wait to show you what we've been building!

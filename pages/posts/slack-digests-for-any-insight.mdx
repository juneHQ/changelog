Want to make sure everyone in your team knows how your metrics evolve over time?

You can now enable Daily, Weekly or Monthly Slack updates for any graph in June.

**How does it work?**

Click on the Slack icon at the top right of a graph card, and configure your custom Slack alert.

## **Other fixes & Improvements**

- Pageviews now appear as normal events both on individual user pages, in the feed and during the onboarding
- We redesigned the Feed table to look consistent with the other tables in the product
- Changed retention graph to be a weighted average of the cohort table (from a normal average)
- We added a full-screen mode on the retention cohort table
- Fixed a bug on the cohort table where we were showing empty cohorts from the present even if the report time was not supposed to include them
- Fixed a bug showing property values with trailing whitespace as different properties from the ones without a trailing whitespace
- We added a skeleton loader for the reports list

export default ({ children, ...rest }) => (
  <MdxLayout meta={meta} {...rest}>
    {children}
  </MdxLayout>
);

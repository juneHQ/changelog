**New template set up**

The new template setup is out. This new editor should be a lot better. It lets you know what information is optional or not, it requires fewer clicks 🖱 and even tells you the percentage of users you picked to run your analysis.

**Other improvements**

- Company milestones: if you're using the [Segment Group identify call](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/identify/) then head to a user profile to see his/her milestones on the sidebar. Milestones allow you to add checkpoints that can be crossed at the company level, no matter the order. This is great to understand if a company crossed your key product milestones 🏔

Have you ever looked at your track events unsure of whether they're being triggered, and more importantly, how often? **Event frequencies** helps you understand how often track events get triggered. These changes are live both for when you are setting up a report and choosing a track event and the events page inside of June. We've also re-ordered track events based on how often they happen too. We think that this context will add a lot of value when choosing the right track events for your reports.

**Other improvements**

- Some events come with properties. These properties have ~~feelings~~ values. Now you can see them from the event page, both their values and how many times they are happening.
- We've added report titles to report insights that you've shared so you know which insight comes from which report.
- We fixed a bug where we were showing company trait filters as user trait filters in the audience section of a report.
- Our public templates page also had some issues which are fixed now.
- A lot of UI polish. We hope that June is a little more pleasing to the eye.

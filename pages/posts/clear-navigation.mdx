We added a clearer navigation to June so that you always know where you stand, even when the navigation menu is collapsed.

If you prefer, you can also use this breadcrumb to navigate the product.

**Other improvements:**

- We're tailoring the product experience by asking basic questions during the onboarding
- New menu switcher: it is easier than ever to switch workspaces and access your settings.

We added support for analyzing your pageviews! We do this by ingesting [Segment page events](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/page/). Besides the graph, you can also look through the pageviews table to analyze the performance of each page in your app. You can reach out to us via Intercom to get into the pageviews beta.

**Other improvements**

- We switched to an analytical database to ingest Segment page events, so expect your reports to load faster as we migrate other large tables to it in the coming weeks!
- A more prominent button for your turning on Slack notifications for your reports!
- Some bug fixes across the app

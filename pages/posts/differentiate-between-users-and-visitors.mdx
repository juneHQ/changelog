This week we focused on helping you understand your report audience: is it about _users_ or _visitors_?

Every time you generate a new template, we tell you which type of users is involved and if you can filter on your audience. _Users_ are identified by your system with a `user_id` whereas _visitors_ have only been assigned an `anonymous_id`.

We also worked hard to provide you with **<a href="https://june.so/template/retention" target="_blank">a detailed guide on user retention</a>**. Measuring retention is the first step towards building world-changing products. You need to know **how to get the most out of it and the common mistakes to avoid**.

**Other improvements:**

- In the active users report, you can now filter out newly tracked users for the period you're looking at (and that made <a href="https://twitter.com/bruvgr/status/1435625298960257030" target="_blank">Hera team happy</a>).
- Want to understand the journey before users start to use your product? Good news! We've launched our signup conversion rate template in beta, reach out to try it out ðŸ˜Š.
- Youâ€™re in a template but not sure which type? You can now see the template type in the header (_user retention_, _feature adoption_, ...).

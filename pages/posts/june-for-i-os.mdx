**Track your retention at a company level**

This week we launched a new report: **company retention**.
With the cohort acquisition table, you see overtime which cohorts of companies stick the most to your product and which ones are going away.

Similarly to our user retention, you just need to select a **signup** event and your **retention** event. Find more information [here](https://intercom.help/junedotso/en/articles/4747062-how-to-set-up-the-retention-template) on how to setup your report.

**Your metrics on the go**

In case you missed out, our June iOS widget is out! We‚Äôve been using it for the past couple of weeks to keep track of our core metrics.
It's been a blast for us, so we decided to share it with the [world](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/june-for-ios)! üåç

The iOS widget is a great way to take a quick look at your metrics and help you progress towards your goal:

- Fast and easy to set up (< 2 minutes) ‚ö°
- No expertise required üë∂
- Widgets are non-intrusive, you only check them if you want to üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

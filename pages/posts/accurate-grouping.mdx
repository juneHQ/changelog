June now allows a more accurate company-level tracking.

Historically, if a user were part of multiple groups, June would not know from which group a user was triggering an action. This is because the action does not have any context for the group. If this is your case June alerts you like this:

![Group 1627.png](https://june-changelog.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/Group_1627_e90bd2f00b.png)

It turns out users sometimes belong to multiple groups. For instance:

- multiple teams
- staging and production environments
- etc

If this is your case, June considers ALL the companies even though a user belongs to several ones.
\*Now you can change that 😃\*\*

To measure with precision from which companies or workspaces a user interaction happened, add the _groupID_ in the event property, like that:

The accurate company tracking works with the [active companies template.](https://june.so/templates/active-groups) and is progressively rolling out to the rest of the product.

## **Other fixes & Improvements**

- Fast drill down into companies when you click on the graph of a company-level report
- We added a one-line summary at the top of all Slack digests
- We're being explicit about what comes in the free and paid plan :)

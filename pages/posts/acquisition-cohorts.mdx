We enhanced the acquisition cohorts on the retention template to let you look at all the users in a cohort, and see the ones that were retained in subsequent days, weeks, or months. You can also choose between percentages and counts.

**Other improvements**

- You can now enable Slack messages for when you achieve the goals that you've set!
- You can now also choose the desired frequency (daily, weekly, or monthly) on retention template
- We also added an option for you to sort your reports by recency or popularity
- On the settings page, you can now look at the number of free plan actions you've used in the current month
- We also tuned our SQL queries to improve report loading speeds, with lots of small bug fixes and improvements across the app

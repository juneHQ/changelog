Do you know which one is your most popular feature? Your second most popular one?

Knowing who adopts your features is the best way to understand your product usage, yet it's hard to do.
To fix that we're introducing the **feature adoption card** to the home!

The card lists your features and their adoption by looking into the [feature adoption reports](https://www.june.so/templates/feature-usage) you generated. Your most adopted features come at the top of the list.

Want to change a report set up, its name, or find out who has adopted it? Just click on it!

**Other improvements**

- You can now create milestones at a company level!

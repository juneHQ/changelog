Last week was special. The whole team met for the first time.

June is a remote-first company: we're 6 people and we work from 3 countries. We gathered for a week in Arcachon, France, to bond and celebrate all the milestones achieved in the past month 🎉

It was a great opportunity to align on our strategy and product vision but mostly the occasion to mingle and enjoy a breath of nature.

In between delicious meals and scenic hikes, we managed to wrap up a couple of cool features, soon to be released 😉

To keep you waiting, we've put together a really nice [playbook on activation](https://june.so/template/activation).

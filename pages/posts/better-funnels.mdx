Let's face it, funnels in June weren't great. So we fixed that.

We built better funnels for you to understand the bottlenecks of your product.

The revamped funnel includes:

- A dropdown with the users that completed/did not complete (with the possibility to download the list)
- The median time between each step
- A vertical view mode, helpful if you have a long list of steps

Also, the period in progress is greyed out now to avoid any confusion.

**Other improvements**

- The slack notification editor supports Slack formatting and nested properties. [See which formats Slack support](https://api.slack.com/reference/surfaces/formatting#visual-styles). You can also search through your Slack channels.

- We added the most adopted features on the Home using your already created [feature adoption reports](https://www.june.so/templates/feature-usage).
- Funnel drill-down will show identified users at the top of the list for more clarity
- You can drill down into the eligible audience on your feature adoption report for more clarity
- We fixed the keyboard defocus when typing a property value
- We fixed the issue with the power companies chart going to zero when Group Context is enabled
- You can search through event properties when selecting an event for a report

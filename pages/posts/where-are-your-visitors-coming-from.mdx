In the New Users report, we now added an insight that tells you where all your visitors are coming from.

The idea is that over time we'll build the new users report to become the place where you can answer all your most common questions about user acquisition.

As a first tiny step in this direction, we added this insight that tells you overall what are the referrers of people visiting your app. This is useful to understand at a high level what are your main traffic sources.

**Other improvements**

- Fix errors on bulk trait addition
- We fixed a long-standing bug with how company audience rules are searched. The results of applying rules like companies where plan is pro are more accurate now for workspaces that are not sending the "group" context
- Fixed some edge case bugs with recommended filters not working
- Fixed a bug on the audience filters for some reports
- Fixed a bug on the displayed name of users in the feed and event feed
- Fixed a bug on the feature home cards not loading for some workspaces
- Fixed a bug on the report setup, where reloads weren't happening automatically after new audience rules were applied
- We added a [customer stories](https://www.june.so/customer-stories) section to our website with some stories about how some great companies are using June

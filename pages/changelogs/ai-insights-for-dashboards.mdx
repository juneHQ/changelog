This week's changelog arrives a little late, I've been traveling to San Francisco and somehow my week got away from me.

With the team we've been doing some great progress on integrating more flexibility in the way you can add charts to your dashboards.

In this week's release we've built a new [Cursor-like](https://cursor.com?ref=june.so) AI assistant to help you write good queries.

Additionally we've added the ability to write queries for company pages.

We've helped a couple of customers to write queries for their company pages as they were missing some insights to be able to make the most out of their dashboards.

This is to say that we've seen firsthand how powerful this can be and are excited to see what you'll build with it.

The new AI insights are also a step towards our very ambitious plan of [removing the need for reports in June](https://changelog.june.so/changelogs/audiences-for-dashboards).



**Other improvements**

- Fix how event log properties are formatted in tooltips
- We improved the sync settings page for CRM syncs to highlight the most recent syncs. You can now see the users synced in the past hours.
- Our HubSpot integration now highlights conflict errors when syncing contacts - so you can keep your CRM data in a clean state.

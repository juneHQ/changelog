At the beginging of June we had this fear that we didn't have enough features to keep our customers engaged.

So we started building out as many reports as we could. Naturally, over time we ended up with two very similar reports.

In an effort to make things easier for our customers we decided to merge the two reports into one.

This change makes it both easier for you to discover - and also makes the individual report itself more useful.

**Other improvements**

- We now generate a domain trait for companies - this allows you to filter them by domain in your audiences.
- We improved the reliability of our main analytics database and the speed of ingesting data - which will make updates of traits on any object faster.
- We fixed a bug with relative timestamps on milestone insights.

This week we've released a super exciting update to our Attio integration.

In the past couple of weeks we released a new UI for mapping data syncs from June into CRMs.

This week we're rolling out these same improvements to our Attio integration.

This means you can now:

- Have different mapping settings for users and companies
- Get a quick overview of the health of your data syncs
- See what objects have been synced over and with what traits

Additionally we've pushed some other improvements to the inital data setup. For instance once you add a mapping to an object, we now automatically create empty mappings for the required and unique fields.

This means it's a lot easier to get your setup right.

Lastly across CRMs we've made some under the hood optimisations to both computed traits and data syncs to only update users that have actually changed.

This means it's now less expensive to run automations in your CRM based on your June data.

**Other improvements**

- We now show non synced entities for each CRM sync in the drilldown UI. This way you can debug your setup more quickly.
- Improvements displaying pageview information in user feed
- We fixed some issues with the matching mapping creation for HubSpot
- Fixed a bug in the explorer report that prevented users from enabling Slack alerts
- Fixd the audience filters copy while adding traits to reflect custom object names

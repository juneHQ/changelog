Sometimes months happen in weeks - this week was one of those weeks.

The past 8 weeks of June have been magical - we've been experiencing some of the best months in June's history.

The product team is evolving our offering as fast as we can and this week we're super proud to announce our most requested feature yet.

We're introducing live monitoring of entering and exiting audiences. This means you can now get live updates over time of which users are entering and exiting your audiences.

Some of the early use-cases we're seeing with our design partners include:

- **Monitoring trialing users** - and being able to handhold them through their trial
- **Proactive churn risk outreach** - getting live updates when individual workspaces start to disengage
- **Upselling at the right moment** - being able to see when users are hitting new tiers or high levels of engagement on existing plans


The customers we're working with can now enable monitoring of an audience from the audience list page.

From there you'll be able to see a live feed of entering and exiting users - additionally you'll be able to send these alerts to Slack, email or webhooks.

If you'd like to learn more about this feature and try it out reach out to us on your shared Slack channel.

## June Provided Traits

This weeks we've also introduced a new set of traits that are automatically provided by June.

The first one is `is_professional_email` which is a boolean trait that indicates if the user has a work email or not.

This is a follow up on our initial work on open-sourcing our [non-work email list](https://github.com/juneHQ/non-work-domains/).

This change is live for all customers - and if you'd like to include an additional domain to the list, feel free to reach out to us or [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/juneHQ/non-work-domains/).

The second trait is `ai_summary` which is a string trait that includes a summary of the workspace activity based on their traits and events.

If you enable alerting for a workspace we'll now automatically generate a summary of all the workspace activity and include it both in the alert email and in the traits for the workspace.

We've completely rewritten our summarisation logic to be more accurate and useful, and can't wait to hear some of your feedback on it.

**Other improvements**

- Add support for Company profile alerts and not only Workspaces
- Improve the invalid state when no delivery channel is selected for Workspace alerts
- Use App's timezone on the event feed *(timezone support is in alpha release for selected customers)*
- Let the people list take full width of the page on large screens
- We now show a helpful date placeholder for trait audience filters that involve dates, so you don't have to guess the correct format

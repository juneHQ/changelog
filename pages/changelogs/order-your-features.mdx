In this week's update we're introducing the ability to order your features in the way that makes the most sense for your team.

In the product home you can now order your features by:

- Adoption
- Users
- Total usage
- Retention
- Launch date

This makes it easier to rank and compare your features based on the metrics that matters most to you.

Understanding how different features are performing is key to making the right decisions about what to build next. We hope this update will make it easier for you to do that.


**Other improvements**

- We pushed some improvements to our onboarding experience
- We added more guidance on how to prompt the June AI explorer
- We fixed a bug with the power users card on the home
- We increased the amount of traits displayed in the user profile
- We added some placeholders on the activation milestone card on the home if you don't have any activation milestones yet

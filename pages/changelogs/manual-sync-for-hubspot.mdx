This week's release includes some improvements to the HubSpot sync.

You can now manually trigger a full sync of your HubSpot data. This is useful in these cases:

- You just set up the HubSpot integration and want to pull in all your data
- You just added some new traits to your CRM syncs and want to re-sync all your data

To trigger a manual sync, you can click the "Sync all users" button in the CRM sync details page.

This should be a huge quality of life improvement for many of you.

As part of this release we've also made some improvements to the way we show the list of all users or companies that have been synced to HubSpot.

**Other improvements**

- We moved the SQL editor to the new chart builder UI
- Slack alerts for events and charts now has a preferred hour - so you can receive alerts at the right time of day no matter where you are in the world
- Lots of bug fixes on the chart editor
- Small design changes to tooltips across the product
- You can now edit the description of a computed trait in the sidebar editor

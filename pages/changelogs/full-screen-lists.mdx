This week we've made a big step towards improving the people list experience in the product.

We've shrinked the whitespace to a minimum to really use as much space as available.

This change is also preparing the ground for one exciting new feature that we'll be announcing in the coming weeks.

## Manual full sync for Attio

Another big thing we're launching this week is the ability to manually trigger a full sync for Attio.

This is useful on your first setup, to be able to sync all your data from Attio to June after setting up the connection.

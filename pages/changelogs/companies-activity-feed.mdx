The first feature I've ever built in June was the user event feed.

The big idea behind it was to give everyone a way to get a list of who their users are and what they're doing.

Over time our product has evolved to be a lot more focused on the needs of B2B companies that sell software to other companies.

This created the need to be able to see what are all the events individual customers are performing?

So this week's release includes a new event feed on company pages, so you can now look at what events people are performing in specific companies or workspaces.

To find this new feature just head to a workspace or company page and click on the Feed tab.

We built this feature because of feedback from customers like you, so if you have something specific in mind you'd want us to build - please share with us your feedback.

When we started at June, the first feature we built was the user event feed.

The big idea behind it was to give everyone a way to get a list of who their users are and what they're doing.

As we've grown, we've focused more on serving B2B companies that sell software to other businesses. We heard your need for more detailed insights into customer activity, and we've responded.

So this week's release includes a new event feed on company pages, so you can now look at what events people are performing in specific companies or workspaces.

To access this feature, simply navigate to a workspace or company page and click on the 'Feed' tab.

We built this feature based on valuable feedback from customers like you. Your input helps us make sure we build the right things, so please continue to share your ideas and suggestions for future improvements. What would you like to see next?

This week we released a new type of computed traits - SQL computed traits.

With SQL computed traits you can now write your own SQL queries to compute whatever traits you want.

The kinds of traits you can compute are:

- Health scores
- Formulas based on different events and properties
- Session times

This is a very powerful set of capabilities that we're excited to see you all use.

To create a SQL computed trait you need to select the "SQL" option in the computed trait creation/edit modal.

You can then write your own SQL query to compute the trait.

Additionally as requested by [Abby this week](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/abbydurbridge_customersuccess-productdevelopment-startup-activity-7324230596350660608-Y_0F/), you can use the "Duplicate" button to create variations of a trait.

**Other improvements**

- Added validation checks to ensure events are properly selected before computed traits can be enabled
- Fixed an issue that was causing computed traits not to run for certain workspaces
- Fixed an issue where the drilldown was showing the wrong results when the dashboard audience is enabled
- We introduced support for custom objects in computed traits
- Fixed a UI problem where the charts tooltips near the end of the cards were not displayed on dashboards

We've worked on two main product improvements this week - one improving our company pages and the other adding a Stripe integration.

## Company pages now support audiences

![Company pages now support audiences](https://june-changelog.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/audiences-for-company-pages-and-stripe-integration/company-audiences.png)

We've added the ability to create and manage audiences for insights on company pages. This allows you to customise your company page to show charts for the right groups of users.

We've learned from a lot of customers that different users within a products can have different types of permissions and goals in terms of engagement.

For example for recruiting software high engagement of the HR team is important as they're the ones in charge of implementing the software - and you might not care about the overall retention of individual hiring managers.

Anyways audience filters are now available on both workspace and company pages - we can't wait to see what you build with them!


## Stripe integration

This week we've added a new Stripe integration in beta.

This allows you to connect your Stripe account to your workspace and automatically sync traits like Total spend, Total revenue, Last payment date, Last payment amount and more.

This integration is not self-serve yet - but if you're interested in getting access to it please reach out in the chat or on your shared Slack channel with us.

## Re-ordering dashboards in the sidebar

Last little easter egg we've added this week is the ability to re-order dashboards in the sidebar.

Simply drag and drop the dashboards to re-order them - just like you do in Notion or Figma.

**Other improvements**

- Fix a bug with the timerange selector on charts
- Improve how audience Slack alerts get formatted
- Fixed an issue where audience screenshot would not show up correctly
- Fixed a bug where the top retained users insight would not take into account audiences

We are proud to announce the unveiling of our latest feature in Screeb. Our commitment to enhancing your user experience and making your data analysis easier and more dynamic has led to the development of an exceptional tool - the Tagging and Classification of Survey Responses feature.

Now, you can effortlessly organize your survey responses into categories, making it simpler to interpret your data and identify patterns. Three unique methods have been strategically designed for this purpose - manual tagging, word detection and smart tagging, each offering distinctive advantages. 

1. _Manual Tagging_: This allows you to manually attribute tags to the responses. It provides full control over the categorization, enabling faster response analysis.

2. _Word detection_: This highlights any response that contains a specific keyword.

3. _Smart Tagging_: We've leveraged advanced AI to automatically assigns tags to responses based on topic. Say goodbye to the hassle and time-consuming process of manually sorting through responses!

With all these methods at your disposal, you can now simplify data analysis, generate comprehensive reports, and gain valuable insights faster and more efficiently than ever before. We understand that data is key to your decision-making process, and our new feature is designed to make that process as smooth and efficient as possible.

At Screeb, we're committed to simplifying the response analysis. So, dive into the world of AI-powered response review and let your product research run wild!

_Experience the Future. Build Surveys with AI._

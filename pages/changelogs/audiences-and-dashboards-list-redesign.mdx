In this week's changelog we've redesigned the audiences and dashboards lists to be faster and more user friendly.

We've noticed some latency issues with the previous implementation and we've implemented a new approach that should fix the issue.

Additionally, we've added a new feature that allows you to favourite audiences and dashboards.

The rest of the time we've been busy with bug fixes and quality of life improvements. Hope you feel the difference!

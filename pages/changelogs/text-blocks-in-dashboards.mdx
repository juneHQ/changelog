One of the most requested features we've had is the ability to add text blocks to dashboards.

This can be useful to add context to the dashboard, or to add a note to the dashboard.

![Text blocks in dashboards](https://june-changelog.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/text-blocks-in-dashboards/text-block.png)

As we've been moving away from the old world of reports and into a more flexible and powerful world of dashboards, we've been improving the types of blocks that can be added to dashboards.

This week's release of text blocks opens up a whole new set of use-cases for dashboards like creating portals to share insights with your customers.

This is just the beginning of new capabilities we're working on, we can't wait to share with you what the next releases will bring.

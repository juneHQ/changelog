At June our mission is to make analytics accessible to anyone. For instance by making analytics faster and more enjoyable!

With CMD+K you can quickly access frequently used parts of the product, such as:

- searching users or companies
- searching a report
- creating a new report

Enjoy your new superpowers! 🦸‍♀️

**Other improvements**

- Events flagged as system events are removed from the feature audit report
- We fixed a bug on audience search for company-level reports where a user trait would rule on all companies the user belongs to.

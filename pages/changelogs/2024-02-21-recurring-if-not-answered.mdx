Exciting news from Screeb! We're rolling out a new feature that enhances how you engage with your audience. With our latest update, you can now set a recurrence rule for surveys that users have seen but not responded to. Here’s what you need to know:

- Customize the recurrence interval from 1 to 365 days, ensuring a follow-up with users who haven’t answered your survey without overwhelming those who have.

Benefit: This feature empowers you to re-engage customers who missed responding while respecting the input of those who have participated. It’s all about striking the perfect balance between collecting valuable feedback and maintaining a respectful, user-friendly experience.

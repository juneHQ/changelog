It's so freaking hard to get people to sign up for your product.

Wouldn't it be a waste not to do everything in your power to get your customers to experience the value of your product?

This week's update was 100% focused on building better tools to identify and mitigate churn risk.

A lot of love and care went into ideating and building these features and we hope you'll find them as valuable as we did.

## Churn risk as part of the retention report

We've now merged the "Churn risk" report with the "Retention" report and built a much better way to track who's at risk of churn.

The way we highlight churn risk is the following:

- We check how many users or companies have stopped using the product for at least two weeks
- We rank them by how many weeks they've used your product for

We found this simple rule to work extremely well and are very curious to see what you do with this.

As always the card supports both seeing the full list of users, and exporting via CSV, so you can import data into a spreadsheet or into your CRM and organise outreach an initiatives with your colleagues.

## Computed traits for changes in activity

We learned that a lot of our customers tend to have two types of computed traits, one for "performed events in the last 30 days" and one for "performed events in the past 7 days".

The reason for this is that it's very powerful to be able to filter churning users by combinining these rules. For example we've heard of a lot of people using something like: "Opened more than 50 reports in the past 30 days, and less than 1 time in the past 7 days" as an audience, both in June and in their CRM.

So this week we decided to build this as part of our product to make it much more of a common workflow that everyone can benefit from and less of an ingenious hack.

**Other improvements**

- Added 1 day as a time-range for the most engaged users report
- Improved the stability of our Attio integration (fixed the invalid email error type and handle unauthorised error)
- We added back the banner for company reports that specifies the company it's focused on
- We pushed a little redesign of our sidebar (credit to [Mateusz](https://dribbble.com/shots/23085229--Analytics-Dashboard) for the inspiration)

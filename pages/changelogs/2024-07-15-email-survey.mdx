Welcome to the new update of our Email Survey!

In this version, we have introduced exciting new features that allow users to create and send surveys in a more engaging format.

One of the key highlights of this update is the ability for users to customize the design and content of the template that will be included in the email body.

There is one custom template per question type, allowing your end users to start answering the survey directly from the email!


export default ({ children, ...rest }) => (
  <MdxLayout meta={meta} {...rest}>
   <Template content={content} />
   {children}
  </MdxLayout>
);

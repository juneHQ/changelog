Guess what? You can now set an audience for your dashboards!

We're moving to a world where reports will be replaced by dashboards.

As much as we love our reports, we understand that most businesses need to be able to customise what they want to measure.

That's why we're bringing over the best parts of our reports into our dashboards.

The first step was introducing the new insight builder a few weeks ago - which allows you to build your own metrics.

This week we're taking this one step further allowing you to set an audience for your dashboards that can be used by any of the cards in the dashboard.

This is an optional setting, so if you need a specific insight for a card in your dashboard you can still customise it.

## Why are we doing this?

We think that having both reports and dashboards is confusing for our customers.

That being said, we're also aware that thousands of people use our reports every month.

So reports can only be something we'll replace progressively and it the least disruptive way possible.

Our strategy for this change is to keep improving our dashboards and make them more powerful and reach the point where most users only create new dashboards and no reports.

Once we reach that point, we'll migrate every report to a dashboard and say goodbye to reports.

**Other improvements**

- You can now sync June with Custom Objects in HubSpot - to access this feature you'll need to reconnect your HubSpot account to June as we need to update our scopes to also include Custom Objects.
- You can now remove internal users from your company pages. Head to the settings page and you'll find the option to remove internal users.
- Fix an issue with the retention line chart cohort picker
- We improved how we validate hubspot properties that be used for mapping
- We added a new button to create computed traits from the audience filters menu

Welcome to the new update of our Dashboard Homepage!
In this version, we have introduced exciting new features that allow users to customize and arrange their homepage according to their preferences.

One of the key highlights of this update is the ability for users to add and arrange the data that they value the most.

Whether it's NPS, CES, response rate, or MAU usage, users now have the flexibility to choose which widgets they want to see on their homepage.

With this new feature, you can easily prioritize the data that is most relevant to you, making your dashboard more personalized and efficient.
No more scrolling through irrelevant information - the Dashboard Homepage puts the power of customization in the hands of our users.

Stay tuned for more updates and enhancements coming soon. Enjoy the new Dashboard Homepage experience!

You can now share your dashboards with others!

Once we introduced our dashboard feature, we've seen a lot of requests to be able to share them with others.

This week we've shipped just that!

Head to the top right of your dashboard and you'll see the new "Share" button.

Additonally, we've polished the experience for those of you who put dashboards on a monitor in your office.

We now persist whether the sidebars and audience filters are open or closed so they don't reset every time you reload the dashboard.

As always, we're looking forward to see what you use this for!

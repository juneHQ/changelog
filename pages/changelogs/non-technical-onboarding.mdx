Half of our new sign-ups are non-technical users. More than half of our users use our SDKs. From looking at our activation metrics we learned that only 10% of sign-ups are able to successfully start sending events to June.

The main reasons why users are not able to successfully start sending events are:

- This is not a priority for them
- They don't have the technical skills to integrate June
- They don't know how long it will take to integrate, and don't want to delay other projects

We can't do much about the first reason, but we can do something about the other two. In the last few weeks we've been working on improving our onboarding experience first for the most motivated users, and now for the less motivated ones.

## What we learned

We do almost 30 onboarding calls every week. This is a great way for us to learn about our users and their needs, so we used learnings from these calls to improve our onboarding experience.

We also looked at the data and found an overlap from our gut feeling and the data.

After looking at our onboarding we had one insight. June started as a tool that integrated with Segment and auto-generated reports. That is because the most valuable thing we could do for our users was to take some of the existing data they were collecting and do the hard work of generating reports for them.

Half of our users now though are starting from scratch. They don't have any data, and so we can't generate any reports for them. What they need is a first quick win, to see enough value in June to keep using it more and more.

## Putting it into practice

Given there's two types of value we can provide to our users, we decided to split our onboarding for users that:

- **Already have data**. We can generate reports for them, so we can show them the value of June straight away. We already were doing a good job here.
- **June is their first analytics tool**. The goal here being fast time to value and education. We didn't have anything here, so we started from scratch.

So what we did is we added a question at the beginning of our onboarding to ask users if they already have data. If they do, we show them the same onboarding we had before. If they don't, we show them a new onboarding.

**Other improvements**

- Fixed the flow of joining multiple teams by domain when signing up
- We now enrich logos for companies that have a domain as part if our enrichment
- You can now add reports into views from the report page
- We moved the User and Company report switched to the top of the report from the bottom dock

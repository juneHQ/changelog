This week we've been trying to bring the audiences experience at the center of the product.

What we noticed as we started moving things around was that there were a couple structural problems in our UI that prevented us from showing the right buttons in the right place.

First we realised that audiences should be included as part of our free plans. So we removed the paywall and made them available to all.

Additionally, given thet were hard to find, we've now pushed a new design of both the main product navigation and the People lists to display more information in less space.

What this also means for this week is that you're no longer limited to having 6 views, the limit is now 10 and we've set the groundwork to allow for how many views as you need.


The big update coming next week, that we haven't been able to wrap up this week is the ability to pin Audiences in the sidebar. So not only audiences will be free to use on all plans, but they'll also be quickly accessible from anywhere in the product.

**Other improvements**

- Fix bug with people list not displaying correctly when there's no pinned traits
- Audiences are no longer paywalled
- Reset page and sorting when switching between objects
- Fix a bug with company links not working
- Use correct object name for the churning risk insights empty state
- Fix a bug with manual trait addition not syncing to CRMs

This week we've been focused on polishing the product and fixing bugs.

Since we redesigned every major screen in the app over the past few weeks, we've been going through the app and fixing bugs and making sure the product is working as expected.

This isn't the most exciting thing to write about, but it's a necessary effort required to ship the product you deserve.

**Other improvements**

- We redesigned the funnel tooltips
- We now format the count of CRM syncs nicely
- We now made the first breadcrumb on dashboards work
- We redesigned the list SQL page
- We fixed an issue with Pingbase embedding
- We now automatically update the trait type to "Workspace member" when syncing data from HubSpot owner fields
- We fixed a bug with drill-downs on dashboards that were causing problems when clicking on a chart
- We added support for mentioning workspace members in Slack alerts
- We improved the dashboard's loading states
- We added a scrollbar to the computed traits editor, so it works properly in the sidebar
- We improved the copy on the CRM Sync audiences section

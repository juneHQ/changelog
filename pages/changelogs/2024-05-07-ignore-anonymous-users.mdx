After receiving feedback from our users, we're excited to announce the launch of a new feature that allows you to ignore activity from anonymous users, by just enabling an option.
Here's what you need to know:

- Anonymous User Filtering: Exclude responses from anonymous users in your survey data.
- Anonymous User Activity: Anonymous users will not be taken into account in your workspace quota and statistics.

This feature provides you with more control over your survey data, allowing you to focus on responses from identified users. By filtering out anonymous responses, you can gain a clearer understanding of your audience and make more informed decisions based on the data you collect.

  <MdxLayout meta={meta} {...rest}>

  </MdxLayout>

This week we're releasing a new way to share data with your customers.

We're calling it our **Customer portal**.

They're a new way to showcase value and craft stories to convey the value your product is delivering.

We believe that the best way to showcase value is to show real data, real users on how people are using your product.

Whether it's the end of a POC or time for a renewal, customer portals are a great way to showcase your product metrics in a way that's easy to understand and engaging.

To be able to better cater to this use-case we've added three new features to our dashboard embedding capabilities:

- Text blocks (released last week)
- Password protection for public dashboards
- Workspace filters for dashboards, so you can highlight the data for one customer at a time

We can't wait to see what you'll do with this!

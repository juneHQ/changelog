One of the inevitable challenges of building a product based on customer data is that we never know what kind of things our customers will do with our product.

Don't get me wrong, we do have in mind a handful of use cases when designing a feature, but each customer will care about different metrics and events.

This week we're rolling out a new feature that allows you to customise the columns of your audiences tables for each of your audiences.

So when you have an audience for current trialing customers you can highlight the trial data and progress towards a paid plan. And at the same time when looking at existing customers you can only include columns related with product engagement - so you can spot churn risk or upsell opportunities.

As small as this might seem - this is incredibly powerful and will allow you to spend less time figuring out the most important metrics for each of your customers.

**Other improvements**

- There's a new Schema documentation that you can use to understand how to write SQL queries to access your data.
- When computed traits like Last Seen haven't been computed yet, we now show a pending state in the audience table.

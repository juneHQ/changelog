This week's release is the culmination of a couple months of work!

Since March we've started a long process of simplification of the core June product.

As our product matures, complex things become possible, but we really want to make sure that simple things to stay simple.

We've now made it so that you can create a new report in June with the least amount of work ever.

On any screen in the product you can now click on "New report" and land into a new report.

To switch between report types, just click on the select menu at the top of the report setup.

The cherry on the cake is that we now display who last updated any given report, so you know who's the last person that changed the setup of any of your reports.

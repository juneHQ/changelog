In the past month we've put all of our energies in making our Hubspot integration the best out there.

One of the biggest gaps left is visibility in the status of data syncs.

While we always displayed some text saying "Last synced at", we didn't make it easy to get more information on what exactly is getting synced over and what errors we're experiencing.

This week we've made some great progress towards making this a lot more transparent.


Building on top of the new Hubspot Sync UI we shipped [last week](https://changelog.june.so/changelogs/new-hubspot-sync-ui) we now released a live status of the latest sync progres and a drilldown, that allows you to see which users have been synced over and what properties have been synced.

We also did the groundwork tobe able to start bubbling up the specific errors that we encounter while getting your product data over to your CRM.

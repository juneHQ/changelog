This week the team focused on improving the product navigation experience.

We've spent a lot of time working on a new navigation structure that makes it easier to find what you need.

The main idea behind this redesign is to highlight the importance of the company pages and audiences and give them a more prominent place in the product.

Let us know what you think!

**Other improvements**

- We added confirmation modal before removing group_id filter from dashboards


export default ({ children, ...rest }) => (
  <MdxLayout meta={meta} {...rest}>
    {children}
  </MdxLayout>
);

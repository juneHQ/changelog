This week's big update is the ability to click into any dashboard and see the users and companies behind the data.

This was one of our signature features in reports, and it's finally available in dashboards - closing one of the biggest gaps in our product.

We're very proud of the complete overhaul of the user, company and dashboard pages we've done over the past few weeks.

Additionally we've added support for sharing private links of company pages, which is a great way to share data with your customers.

It feels great to see all the hard work finally come together and we can't wait to hear what you all think of the new pages.

If you haven't already, please take a moment to check out the new pages and give us some feedback. It really helps us improve the product for you.

**Other improvements**

- You can now re-assign all the alerts and dashboard to another user once you remove someone from the team.
- We fixed an error with the events list not loading for apps with over 60k events. We hadn't architected for this and it was causing a performance issue for a customer.
- Fixed an error where the Hubspot link and the toast on the user profile crm card were not consistent with each other.

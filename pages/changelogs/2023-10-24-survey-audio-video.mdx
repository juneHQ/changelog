Today, we're launching a new way to interact with your users from your website and mobile app on the Screeb platform:

📽️ Ask questions in video and get a 35% higher response rate than text surveys!

Collect answers in video or 🎙 in voice note (yes, like in WhatsApp) and receive richer, more spontaneous insights from your users!

🎉 It's a major evolution that we're very proud of, and one that our first users, in beta since last June, already can't live without.

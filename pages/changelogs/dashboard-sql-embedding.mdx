Our SQL insights for dashboards are now embeddable via the product UI and not anymore only via the API.

This allows customers to embed June charts in their own websites or share them with customers without having to go through a technical setup.

This also aligns the behavior of the product so that both SQL insights and charts created with the insight builder can be embedded in the same way.

**Other improvements**

- Fixed an issue that was blocking a customer from setting up the Attio integration correctly.

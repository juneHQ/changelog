Audiences now support Slack notifications. Get notified **instantly**, daily or weekly when an audience changes.

If a user or a company is added or removed from an audience you'll get a notification in Slack.

The setup is simple and looks exactly like the one for Event notifications:

Just head to your favorite audience and click on the **Add Slack notification** button in the top right corner.

We're working on adding self-serve support for email and webhook notifications as well - expect those soon!

**Other improvements**

- We now support ratios as computed traits - like number of reports opened per user
- Allow to view more than 5 steps on funnel insight cards
- Make sure the computed traits menu overlay is not cut off when opening from the sidebar
- Improved full page design for the People page
- We improved the design for the unidentified users page - better highlighting the most important information
- We pushed some improvements to make it easier to contribute to our ["Non work domains" repository](https://github.com/juneHQ/non-work-domains/)

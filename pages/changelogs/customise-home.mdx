# Customise your home

This week we're releasing one of the most long-awaited features: the ability to customize your product home. You can now add your cards from any report into your product home.

While building June our approach has been to always build a restrictive first version of things that delivers value. Then over time, once the core experience is solid, open things up to customization, addressing the issues that arise from the first versions.

When we're building a v1 of a feature typically one needs to make a compromise.

The way we like to think of this compromise is by comparing building a Guitar Hero or a Guitar.

Guitar Hero is a game where you can play a guitar without knowing how to play a guitar. It's a game that's easy to pick up and play. Within minutes you can be playing a song. It's a game that's easy to learn, but that doesn't allow you to play whatever you want.

A guitar on the other hand is a much more complex instrument. It takes a lot of time to learn how to play it. But once you do, you can play whatever you want.

When we're building a v1 of a feature we try to build it like Guitar Hero. We want things to be fast to set up and valuable from day one. This is because many more people will be able to use it and get value from it. This means we can get feedback fast and then iterate towards adding more flexibility and customization.

This is what we did with the product home. We built a first version that was fast to set up and valuable from day one. This meant that we had to make some compromises.

The first version of the product home was hard-coded to show the most important cards in your account.

The second version, we added the ability to specify which reports you wanted to get those cards from. This was a big improvement, but it still wasn't enough.

Today we're releasing the third version of the product home. This version allows you to add any card from any report into your home and customize the layout.

To try it out, go to your product home and click on the "Edit" button. You'll then be able to change the cards that are shown in your workspace's home.

## Other improvements

- We started working on more advanced audience filtering options for the people list and reports. This work is still in progress - but we're hoping to release it for you next week.

Since the early days of June something we've heard as a recurring request was the ability to show your June dashboards to your customers.

This week we're excited to release an exciting update to our analytics capabilities.

You can now both embed dashboards in your product - and share metrics for individual customers.

What's more is that we built a api to allow you to consume June data in your own products.

This means you can build your own custom dashboards for your customers, powered by June data.

This is super exciting for those of you who need to build things like usage dashboards and reporting tools for your customers.

We can't wait to see what you build. To try it out reach out to us via the Intercom chat.

**Other improvements**

- We fixed an issue with our Stripe checkout links
- We fixed an issue when displaying the last synced at date
- We added support for Active Users Ratio insights for a specific workspace
- We added a description for the activation user insight
- We fixed an issue with the drilldown search on charts not loading properly in some cases
- We added a "June profile URL" trait that you can sync to your CRM. This gives you a URL you can click on in your CRM to open the June profile of a user or company.

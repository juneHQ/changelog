Last week we shared our improvements for those that are less technical. This week instead we're releasing the all new "Developers" section of June.

Taking inspiration from Stripe, we've built a new section of June that is dedicated to developers.

We've added a live debugger that allows you to see the data that is being sent to June in real time. So that you can get instant feedback on what you're sending to June.

These new developer tools also guide you through the process of setting up June.

This is a huge step forward for us as historically we've had a lot of back and forth email conversations with customers to help with set up. Now we can guide you through the process and you can get set up in minutes.

**Other improvements**

- Improved data deletion process - this resulted in shorter deletion times from the moment you request deletion to the moment your data is deleted. We're now able to delete your data within 48 hours.
- Design polish on the report page - we've moved the edit button to the top right as we're seeing less people editing reports since moving the button to the bottom dock.
- Fixed many more small bugs and issues that you've reported to us.

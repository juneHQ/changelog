This week we've finally wrapped up one of the biggest features of this year.

We're two months into Custom objects and we're finally ready to release it to all our customers.

This feature is a game changer for many of our B2B customers that need to track different kinds of groups of users and want to have different pages with different insights.

It's really exciting to see how many use cases this enables.

We've already seen different use cases from handling complex enterprise deployments in many different teams, to helping restaurant businesses track restaurants and franchises separately.

**Other improvements**

- We fixed the audience section for Slack notifications
- We fixed an issue where the type of output was not showing on Computed Traits
- We fixed how the event logs were displayed in developer tools
- We fixed an issue where the matching identifier was disappearing when switching Attio objects
- We fixed an issue where duplicating audiences did not work

Do you have some important data in HubSpot that you'd want to have in June as well?

We've got you covered! You can now add a mapping to sync some data from HubSpot back into June.

This makes it super easy to get data like Deal Stage or Owner into June.

To use this new feature, just open the settings of your HubSpot integration and add a new mapping in the .

We can't wait to see what you'll build with this!

**Other improvements**

- We moved our application API to run on backend.june.so given some adblockers were blocking api.june.so making the app unaccessible from Arc browser.
- We fixed an issue causing the cards to reload when adding new insights
- We updated the is not audience filter to also include objects that do not have a specific trait.
- We updated the funnel conversion UI to show more detailed information for each step in the funnel.
- We now allow percentage outputs in computed traits - you can create ratios like number of active seats over the number purchased seats.
- We now support syncing to percentage outputs in Salesforce.

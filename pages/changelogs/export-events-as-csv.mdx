Early in the week we got a request from our friends at [Luminovo](https://luminovo.com/) to be able to export data for a single event.

We've accomodated many one-off requests in the past, but this was a manual process that took time for us to do.

We decided to automate this, so that not only it's faster to get data exported, but it also doesn't take any time from our team.

To export data for an event you can visit an event page, open the action menu in the top right of the screen and select the **Export as CSV** option.

With AI tools to analyse data like the ChatGPT data analyst and Claude getting more popular, we hope that you can get even more value from your product usage data by being able to export it.



**Other improvements**

- We decreased the latency for the first and last seen computed trait calculations
- We improved the demo workspace data for you to get a better sense of how our company level features work. We also fixed the events list.
- We added a loading placeholder for the CRM syncs table
- We fixed the billing start and end date after you downgrade your plan from Growth to Free
- We now open Intercom help center articles directly in the messenger
- We how show whether a computed trait is live or paused on the People table

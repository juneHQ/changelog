After you start using June for some time, you'll notice that some of your traits aren't relevant anymore.

Up until now, these traits would be cluttering your lists of filters and user profiles.

As we've been facing the issue ourselves for quite some time, we decided it was time to address it.

In this week's June update, you can now archive traits that are no longer relevant from the Objects pages.

Archiving a trait will remove it from the list of audience filters and user profiles. We hope this will help you keep your lists clean and manageable.


**Other improvements**

- Fixed a bug that was causing the developer tools to crash when sending an object with an invalid payload

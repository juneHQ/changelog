This week's updates are a huge step forward in supporting a no-code setup of June!

The first thing we shipped was the new manual event creation in the product. This allows non-technical teammates to create events in the product UI.

We first had the idea for this a couple of years ago, but never got to actually ship this until now.

The main trigger for this has been an onboarding session we did with Ryan Singer - where we went through the whole set up of the product together and identified some of the pain points.

One of the most frustrating things we've found was the awkward handover between technical and non-technical teammates.

This new update allows you to create events manually from the UI, set them up in reports and then invite a colleague to implement them.

## Pageview computed traits

A second update we rolled out this week is computed traits for pageviews.

This one's easy to explain - if you have a product that relies on pageviews you can now just use them as part of your computed traits.

## Users Sync for Attio

A couple of months ago we've built the ability to sync users to Attio for our own instance. This week we've improved it and released it to all Pro customers.

Around ten companies have been using it for a month or so without any major problems. So we're happy to make it available to all now.

**Other improvements**

- Fix CRM sync drill down for the Attio integration
- We now allow setting "Any event" in the setup of feature reports
- We added a new feature audit insight that you can add to views and company pages with an easy to read table.
- We now disable the sync settings when integrations are uninstalled
- We standardised the product UI to use UTC time everywhere
- We added a refresh button for CRM properties - so if you create a new property, you can see it right away!

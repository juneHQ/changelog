In this week's update we're introducing some major improvements to how feature audit works.

Previously, we were only allowing you to set one event per feature. This was limiting the usefulness of the report when a feature was triggered by multiple events.

Our new feature audit report allows you to group multiple events together. This will make it easier to understand what people are doing in your product and how they are using your features.

As part of this change we also merged the two blocks under the feature audit scatter plot into one. With this new design we show side by side for each feature the number of users that used a feature and the times it was used.

## Event property filtering in audiences

Another long awaited feature is the ability to filter audiences by event properties. As some of you might know event properties were already supported as part of the reports setup. Now you can use them to create audiences as well.

With this change we also redesigned how audience filters look like. We found that the previous design was taking too much space and was not very intuitive. We hope you like the new design.

## Other improvements

- We improved the trait mapping experience for our Hubspot integration
- Various bugs across the product

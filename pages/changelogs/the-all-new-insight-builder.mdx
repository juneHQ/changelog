This week I've got some MASSIVE updates for you.

This was very tough to do, but I'm super proud of the team for pulling it off.

So a couple of weeks ago we set out to make June company profiles even more powerful.

Starting today, you can now build your own custom insights without having to create a full report.

To help you appreciate the new builder, let me show you what I love about it.

## Contribution Graph

Our friends at Multi, that are now building the [ChatGPT Desktop app](https://multi.app/blog/multi-is-joining-openai), showed us some months back how they were measuring how different people within a company were using their product.

I thought to myself, we need to add this to June.

And not only that, but we need to make it so you can filter this however you like.

Here's what we came up with:

You can try this out by visiting any company profile and clicking on the new "Add Insight" button.


## Trend Insights

We've added a new type of insight that shows you how something is trending.

This is just one of the many types of insights you can build. 

You can try this out by visiting any view, or the company profile page and clicking on the new "Add Insight" button.

Here's a full video explaining why and how we built this:

We can't wait to see what you build with this. If you come up with something cool, I'd be psyched if you shared it with us on Twitter at [@junedotso](https://x.com/junedotso) or replying to this email.


**Other improvements**

- We added support for Daily, Weekly and Monthly time granularity to the Funnel conversion analysis.
- We added a new Conversion Window setting to the Funnel analysis.
- We fixed a bug with the wrong colours displayed in the vertical funnel tooltip.
- We now have a [new API for data deletions](https://help.june.so/en/articles/8061155-programmatically-delete-users). You can both delete companies and users and check the status of ongoing deletions.
- We fixed an issue with data deletions before a certain date not removing users from belonging to companies correctly.

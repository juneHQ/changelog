This week we're introducing a new version of the most loved page of our app: the company page.

As we see more and more Customer Success teams adopting June we released a new redesigned version of the company page that is more suited for non-technical users.

## What's new?

- **New UI**: The new company page is more intuitive and easier to use.
- **Pin traits at the top**: You can now pin traits to make them appear at the top of the page.
- **Fast editing for traits**: Traits are now editable directly from the page. We also added two new trait types, options and users.

## Editing traits

In the last couple of weeks we've introduced data types for traits. This was a big step to allow sorting and filtering on traits depending on the data type.

This week we're extending the trait editing experience to show the right type of input for each data type.

Here's how it looks when a trait is of the new "option" type:

Here's how it looks when a trait is of the new "workspace member" type - useful for tracking the owners of an account:

Of course, we support strings, dates, numbers and booleans as well.

Each update you make is saved automatically and is reflected on the page instantly.

## What's next?

Next week we'll polish the rough edges of this new page and make its changes also available for the user page.

**Other improvements**

- The HubSpot app now supports the reverse sync of both owner and enum properties. The owner sync will automatically match your HubSpot users with your June workspace members.

This week we've added the ability to use PostHog as a data source to your June account.

This means you can now use PostHog as a CDP to power your June dashboards.

The integration is available in the data sources section of the June platform - and the setup is just a few clicks.

We've recently seen a lot of customers using June side by side with PostHog to get the best of both worlds, and we're excited to make it easier to combine the two.

**Other improvements**

- Fixed a bug with the Slack alert editor
- We fixed an issue that was causing HubSpot syncs to require at least one property to be mapped for the reverse sync to work as expected
- Fixed a UI issue in audience filters. The comparison type selection overflowed outside of the screen. Making it impossible to select some filters on small screens
- We removed animal avatars and adopted a more neutral tone - to accomodate use-cases where you might want to share dashboards with your customers.

This week we're introducing more transparency to the limits and usage of computed traits.

We pushed some design improvements to the computed traits page and have added a new banner showing the limits of usage on computed traits.

Additionally, we've increased the limits for computed traits to only consider the number of live traits on your account not the total number of computed traits.

With these changes we're hoping to clear out confusion around the limits and usage of computed traits for new users - and provide more value to our existing customers.

**Other improvements**

- Fixed an issue where CSV exports on insights in company pages were not working
- We now show relationships and support SQL insight on custom object profiles
